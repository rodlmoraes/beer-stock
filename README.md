# Beer Stock
I developed this project to learn and practice more Java,
Spring and mainly JUnit.

This is a very simple API, with only one entity, a Beer.\
Here you can manage your beers, adding, deleting, 
incrementing and decrementing their quantity, and finding them.

### Requirements
You need to have:
- Java 11 (or higher);
- Gradle 6.8.3.

### Running the API
The easiest way is to just clone this repo, open the project
with your favorite IDE, and use its features to run it.

You have some commands that you can run inside the project's folder:
- `gradle bootRun` another way to run your application
- `gradle build` to build your application
- `gradle test` to run tests

### Endpoints
You can import this postman collection with examples of all 
endpoints, they are ready for you to play with your beers:
